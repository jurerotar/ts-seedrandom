# ts-seedrandom

Seeded random number generators for JavaScript, ported to TypeScript. Based on https://github.com/shanewholloway/js-esm-seedrandom.

## Installation

```shell
npm install ts-seedrandom
```

## Usage

Each generator includes the following methods:
* `quick` - Default method used. Provides 32 bits of randomness in a float. Can either be called by calling generator instance directly (ex. `generator()`) or by name (ex. `generator.quick()`).
* `double` - Provides 56 bits of randomness.
* `int32` - Providers a 32 bit (signed) integer.
* `state` - Provides internal generator state. Used for saving and restoring states.

```ts
import { prngAlea } from 'ts-seedrandom';

const aleaGenerator = prngAlea('seed');
const firstValue = aleaGenerator();
const secondValue = aleaGenerator();
```

You also have the option of saving and restoring state of your generator.

```ts
import { prngAlea } from 'ts-seedrandom';

const aleaGenerator = prngAlea('seed');
const firstValue = aleaGenerator();

// Return internal generator state, which you can use in other generator instances
const state = aleaGenerator.state();

// This generator starts from the same state as first generator, but runs independently
const secondAleaGenerator = prngAlea('seed', state);
```

## Available Algorithms

The following PRNG algorithms are available:

1. `prngAlea`: Alea algorithm
2. `prngArc4`: ARC4 algorithm
3. `prngTychei`: Tyche-i algorithm
4. `prngXor128`: XorShift128 algorithm
5. `prngXor4096`: XorShift4096 algorithm
6. `prngXorshift7`: XorShift7 algorithm
7. `prngXorwow`: Xorwow algorithm

You can import and use any of these algorithms in the same way as demonstrated in the usage examples above.
